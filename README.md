## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Affordable insurance for small business owners. Historically this has been an underserved market,
usually dominated by large insurers who cater to large commerical customers. Small business owners tend to be neglected in this market because
of the high transaction costs involved in commercial lines insurance. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

-Commercial insurance gross written premium = $300B (source iii.org)

-30M small businesses in the US. 

-Market size for direct online sales of small business insurance estimated at $3.7 billion in 2020 and 
and could grow to $12 billion by 2025. ( source Novarica)

Intended customer is the small business owners - initally started off with fitness instructors and 
photographers but has branched out further. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites 
like Stackshare to find this information.)

The company is using AI and data science to process as many claims as possible in under 48 hours. 

They recently aquired two companies - AP Intego & Juniper Labs. 
1) AP Intego is a digital insurance agency that built partnerships with some of the largest small business software ecosystems 
in the US, including Intuit, Gusto, Square and Toast; and 
2) Juniper Labs, a provider of alternative open data and underwriting technology to accelerate the development of 
enhanced machine-learning capabilities.


## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Insurtech for Small businesses. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Insurance and reinsurance has long been a dinosaur of the financial industry. However, recently many insurtech startups have been entering the market and forcing large established companies to start innovating in better data collection and risk analysis. The biggest trend in the insurance industry has been the push towards AI and big data.

Insurance companies are trying to use technology to offer more tailored and personalized solutions with flexible coverage. Online apps now allow customers to make claims or get quotes within minutes with what typically could have taken a week or more. All of this flexibility requires insurance companies to have a more refined understanding of the claims and risks. Robotic Process Automation and AI is allowing for faster claims processing. AI is reducing the need for brokers and paperwork and claims fraud. Bots are being used on the front end to answer clients questions quickly and bots on the back-end are being used to assess risk and payout claims within minutes. 

Companies are now able to collect real-time and accurate data on their loss exposures to individual clients. Drones and imaging technologies will enable insurers to obatin high-deinfition images of properties for more accurate risk assesment. As the data becomes more refined - insurers will need to find a way to handle the information efficently. 

Blockchain is something that insurers have been speaking about but yet to see any real deployment. It will be the next trend as the need for huge volumes of data will need to be processesd and shared accross different organizations. 38+ major insurance companies joined an initiative called B3i to explore blockchain applications in insurance. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Traditionally - has been served by large insurers such as Chubb, Travelers, Liberty, Zurich and AIG ( combined own 22% of the market - source iii.org). Other companies trying to do the same
include: biBerk (backed by berkshire hathaway) and Pie Insurance ( workers comp only).

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

After they purchased AP Intego in 2021 their GWP doubled to $400m.

During the pandemic they had a big push to support small businesses getting back to work. Their premiums are about
25% lower than the industry - small business owners can get a quote in a matter of minutes online. Typical process requires a lot of paperwork
and is labor intensive - which is why traditional insurers would prefer to underwrite large commerical accounts. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 
How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Combined ratio = (sum of incurred losses and expenses) divided by total earned premium. 
If the ratio is less than 100% the company is making an underwriting profit.

Loss ratio = total incurred losses/ total collected insurance premiums. 
The lower the loss ratio the more profitable the insurance company. 

As a privately held company - its difficult to find recent financials. S&P published a combined ratio of 256.4 in 2019 Q4 and GWP $100M. Since they've made 
acquisitions and further in roads into the market these ratios likely have improved.

After the purchase of AP Intego in 2021 their GWP is estimated at $400M.

Loss ratio = NA

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Next insurance has a 2x higher GWP compared to Pie insurance (however Pie focuses on workers compensation only). 

Pie Insurance - pure workers comp play = $185M annualized premium (as at Q1 2021)

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
(This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Small business owners want a one stop shop for all their insurance needs - offering other lines of business such as personal 
homeowners, renters and auto would expand their product offering and client base. They could either enter the market themselves or partner with another neo-insurance 
company such as a Lemonade (personal homeowners and renters insurance). They could also partner with or another 
technology company to improve data collection for example using Zendrive (for auto) for better driver data. Zendrive uses sensors in clients phone to monitor 
and manage driver behavior. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Going into addtional lines offers the company diversification and addtional revenue streams. 
Partnering with another technology company will allow Next insurance to further refine their understanding of client risks which will better inform claims and underwriting. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

AI/Machine learning and chat bot - same technology leveraged into additional lines of business. Zendrive uses Mobility Risk Intelligence (MRI) platform to 
monitor drivers behavior.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Insurance companies need accurate and realtime data on their risks in order to accurately underwrite. Using AI allows them to spend up the analysis of claims data and removes
human error and reduces claims fraud. Using additional technology such as what Zendrive employs allows them a more refined view of their risks.
